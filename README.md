I choose Wealthsimple, a Canadian online investment management service focused on millennials.
# WEALTHSIMPLE 

## Overview and Origin

WealthSimple Technologies Inc. was incorporated and founded 7 years ago in September 2014 by Michael Katchen, Brett Huneycutt and Rudy Adler. The original idea was to make investments accessible, easy to use and to understand for any person from any brackground.  

“Half a Million Mikes” is premised on the claim that there are more than 450,000 “Mikes” in Canada. One of these is Wealthsimple co-founder and CEO Michael Katchen, and his story of going from numbers geek to reluctant Bay Street whiz is told in the spot, which emphasizes that Wealthsimple products are for everyone, not just for “1%-ers.” 

To-the-date, WealthSimple is funded by 17 investors. They have raised a total of $900.4M in funding over 9 rounds. 


## Business Activities:

Wealthsimple offers financial tools to help investors grow and manage their money. The company builds a diversified portfolio of ETFs on the investors' behalf and guides them in achieving their financial goals. 

The company appeals to a younger generation who values full transparency in communicating as well as socially responsible investing. Such as, investment practices, ethical investing and how the millennials view retirement. In other words, to humanize money and make it simple, accessible to help enable people to live the lives they dreamed of. Some features the company offers are: 

* Simple and straightforward user-interface. 

* Low management fee of 0.5% per year.

* Investments are insured up to 100k CAD. 

* Allows automated deposits. 

On the other hand, some disadvantages that users had encountered are: deposit takes a few days to reflect on bank statement and failed auto-deposit might show as successful deposit until it's corrected. Does not allow to fund the account using debit or credit card.

Wealthsimple have implemented 29 technology products and services including HTML5 , Google Analytics, and jQuery , according to G2 Stack. Wealthsimple is actively using 63 technologies for its website, including: Viewport Meta , IPhone / Mobile Compatible , and Google Font API. 

## Landscape:

WealthSimple is part of the Robo Advisors and Personal Finance domain of the financial industry. 

The list of the five largest robo-advisors is constantly changing, with platforms doubling in size under short periods and offering similar cash management products that get lumped together with traditional robo-advisory services, such as: The Vanguard Group, Wealthfront, Charles Schwab Corporation, Betterment, SoFi Automated Investing, E*TRADE Core Portfolios, etc.

## Results

WealthSimple business impact focuses in a trend that is here to stay: Investing with an eye toward environmental, social, and governance concerns.  

The Canadian Robo-Advisory have adapted the ESG investing approach to further manage portfolios focusing on any number from specific concerns: from greenhouse gas emissions to human rights to executive compensation. However, their focus goes to Impact Investing, which is a powerful strategy for social change that is likely to continue garnering solid interest over time. Companies are increasingly attuned to investors’ social consciousness, and investors are increasingly empowered to see social issues as legitimate factors influencing investment decisions.

As one of the biggest robo advisor in Canada and now branched out into both the US and UK markets, WealthSimple has a good selection of investment ideas and offers its clients ready access to actual human investment managers.

Wealthsimple Trade is the only investing platform in Canada that doesn’t charge commission fees for buying and selling stocks and ETFs. Furthermore, there is no minimum investment needed to open a Wealthsimple Trade account, and Wealthsimple Trade will reimburse an outgoing administrative transfer fee up to $150 on investment account transfers valued at more than $5,000. In addition, they’re offering new account holders a $50 cash bonus if you deposit and trade $150.

## Recommendations

For technology platforms, data is the lifeblood. Now it’s clear that the future of financial institutions is impossible without digitalization and data integration. When some companies started to go the way to build a cohesive ecosystem where data can flow easily from one platform to the other, there are still many gaps to fulfill when it comes to integrations. For those who see the growth point in integrating data flows, it should be very interesting to learn how to make the process as predictable as possible.

By WealthSimple extending their account type to RESP, LIRA, RIF, LIF. and allow reimbursement for any account without any $ limitation, it will allow them to grow more in the North American market, offering Canadians, for example, more investment options adjustable to their lifestyle by creating USD account since their mission is to help millenials to start investing, having USD accounts will allow them to gain more investors. 
 
To create frontends for robo-advisors, generally, frameworks, such as AngularJS and React, are used. However, in my opinion, ETL Processing seems to be a great technology addition.
